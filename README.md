# EscroFi Tech Overview

Website: EscroFi.net

Welcome to the EscroFi technology repository! This document provides a high-level overview of how EscroFi works and how developers can get started.

## What is EscroFi?
EscroFi is a smart-contract-based payment solution for freelancers and clients, providing secure escrow, instant payments, and decentralized dispute resolution on the blockchain.

## How the Tech Works
- **Smart Contract Escrow:** Funds are locked in a smart contract until project milestones are completed and verified by both parties.
- **DAO Governance:** Disputes are resolved through decentralized, community-driven arbitration.
- **Instant Payments:** Upon milestone approval, funds are released instantly to freelancers.
- **Reputation System:** On-chain reputation scores for both clients and freelancers.
- **Multi-Signature Security:** Large transactions require multiple signatures for enhanced security.
